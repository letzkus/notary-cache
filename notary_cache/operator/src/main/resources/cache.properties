####### Instance configuration #######
# Attributes are used to configure on which interface
# notary-cache runs on and which TCP port it should use.
#
# ATTENTION:
# An instance of notary cache should only run on localhost 
# and never, never, NEVER on any other interface.
#
# Potential interfaces based on OS:
# - Debian-based Distributions: lo
# - Apple Mac OSX: lo0
# - Windows Server: loopback
instance.interface=lo0
instance.ip=127.0.0.1
instance.port=8081

####### External configuration #######
# Attributes are used to connect to notary-cache to download
# the cache and to access the notary using the protocol
# specified later. Usually, the external IP and domainname
# are entered, such as
# external.ip=173.194.113.151
# external.hostname=google.com
# external.port=80
# external.secure_port=443
# for google.com.
external.ip=127.0.0.1
external.hostname=localhost
external.port=80
external.secure_port=443

####### Contact information #######
# Contact information can be used by individuals to contact
# a system administrator. If contact is undesired, than simply
# leave this attributes empty.
base.contact=
base.pgpid=

####### System constrains #######
# System constraints are used to limit notary cache's capabilities.
# The notary adapts to different system parameters and pauses execution,
# if the attribtues configured are reached.
hw.traffic=
hw.bandwidth=

####### Cache configuration #######
# This information are used to limit the lifetime of an entry in 
# the cache. If no limit should be configured, simply leave the 
# entry_lifetime-attribute empty. 
# However, it is a good decision to keep the configuration as it is.
cache.entry_lifetime = 6
cache.entry_lifetime.unit = HOURS

####### Replicates configuration #######
# If the cache is replicated to other hosts, which could be 
# used as download points as well, the hosts can be inserted here.
# EXAMPLE: 
# replicates.uri=cdn1.provider.de,cdn2.provider.us
# replicates.probability=0.9
replicates.uri=
replicates.probability=

####### Notary configuration #######
# This configuration is sophisticated and should only be changed 
# by system administrators running own notaries. Currently, the
# following notaries are supported:
# - Default: This notary executes requests in realtime and saves
#            digests directly in the cache or returns them to the
#            client.
# - Perspectives: This notary forwards requests to a Perspectives
#			 notary. If Perspectives returns any digest, the
#            is saved in the cache.
#
# It is ok to stick with the Default notary.
notary.protocol=Default
notary.hostname=localhost
